# 1. **Initialization**:
#    - `directions`: A list of tuples representing the four possible directions to move in the order: right, down, left, up. Each tuple contains the change in row and column indices for that direction.
#    - `result`: A list to store the coordinates of the points visited in the spiral order.
#    - `steps`: A counter to track the number of steps to take in the current direction. Initially set to 0.
#    - `total_cells`: The total number of cells in the grid, which is `R * C`.
#    - `x`, `y`: The current position, initially set to the starting point `(rStart, cStart)`.
#    - `dir_index`: An index to keep track of the current direction. Initially set to 0 (right).

# 2. **Main Loop**:
#    - The loop continues until we have visited all the cells in the grid (i.e., until `len(result) < total_cells`).

# 3. **Increase Steps**:
#    - We increase the number of steps after completing two direction changes (right-down or left-up). This is because in a spiral pattern, we move in pairs of directions with the same step count (e.g., 1 step right, 1 step down, then 2 steps left, 2 steps up).

# 4. **Move in the Current Direction**:
#    - For each step in the current direction:
#      - Check if the current position `(x, y)` is within the grid bounds (0 ≤ x < R and 0 ≤ y < C). If it is, add `[x, y]` to the `result`.
#      - Move to the next position in the current direction using the `directions` list. Update `x` and `y` accordingly.

# 5. **Change Direction and ensure it cycles through 0 to 3**:  (dir_index + 1) % 4:
#    - After completing the required number of steps in the current direction, update `dir_index` to the next direction using 'dir_index + 1 '. The modulo operation (`% 4`) ensures that `dir_index` cycles through the values 0 to 3, corresponding to the directions right, down, left, and up. In other words, using % 4 ensures that after the index reaches 3 (the last index in the directions list), it goes back to 0.

### Example Walkthrough

# Let's walk through the example with `R = 5`, `C = 6`, `rStart = 1`, `cStart = 4`:

# 1. **Initialization**:
#    - Start at `(1, 4)`.
#    - Directions: right, down, left, up.
#    - Steps: initially `0`.

# 2. **First Move (Right)**:
#    - Increase steps to `1` (since `dir_index % 2 == 0`).
#    - Move right for 1 step:
#      - `(1, 4)` → `(1, 5)` (within bounds, add `[1, 4]` and `[1, 5]` to the result).
#    - Change direction to down.

# 3. **Second Move (Down)**:
#    - Move down for 1 step:
#      - `(1, 5)` → `(2, 5)` (within bounds, add `[2, 5]` to the result).
#    - Change direction to left.
#    - Increase steps to `2` (since `dir_index % 2 == 0`).

# 4. **Third Move (Left)**:
#    - Move left for 2 steps:
#      - `(2, 5)` → `(2, 4)` → `(2, 3)` (within bounds, add `[2, 4]` and `[2, 3]` to the result).
#    - Change direction to up.

# 5. **Fourth Move (Up)**:
#    - Move up for 2 steps:
#      - `(2, 3)` → `(1, 3)` → `(0, 3)` (within bounds, add `[1, 3]` and `[0, 3]` to the result).
#    - Change direction to right.
#    - Increase steps to `3`.

# 6. **Continue This Pattern**:
#    - Continue moving in the spiral pattern, incrementing steps appropriately and changing directions, until all cells are visited. 
# By following this method, we visit all cells in the grid in a spiral order efficiently, ensuring we capture every point as required.
