            if nums[j:j + len(groups[i])] == groups[i]:
                # If it matches
                j += len(groups[i]) # move j forward by the length of the matched subarray. This line ensures that elements of nums that have already been part of a matched subarray are not considered again.
                i += 1              # move i by one to the next group
            else:

                j += 1              # move j by one to the next starting position in nums
        print(i)
    
        # If we have matched all groups, return True
        return i == len_groups

# Example usage:
groups = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4]]
nums = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(Solution().canChoose(groups, nums))  # Output: False

# Note:
# Disjoint subarrays mean non-overlapping subarrays. In the context of the problem, it means that no index in nums 
# should be part of more than one subarray from groups. Each subarray from groups should match a contiguous, 
# distinct part of nums without sharing any elements with the other subarrays.

#### Two-Pointer Approach

# 1. **Initialize Pointers**:
#    - `i` to track the current subarray in `groups`.
#    - `j` to track the current position in `nums`.

# 2. **Iterate Through `nums`**:
#    - Use the pointer `j` to check if the current subarray in `groups` can be found starting at `nums[j]`.
#    - If a match is found, move the `j` pointer forward by the length of the matched subarray and move the 'i' pointer by one to the next subarray in `groups`.
#    - If no match is found, move the `j` pointer forward by one to check the next possible starting position in `nums`.

# 3. **Check Completion**:
#    - If all subarrays in `groups` are matched within `nums`, return `True`.
#    - If the end of `nums` is reached without matching all subarrays, return `False`.



### Walkthrough of Example
# - Input: `groups = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4]]`, `nums = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

# 1. **Initialization**:
#    - `i = 0`, `j = 0`.

# 2. **First Iteration**:
#    - Check if `nums[0:3]` (which is `[7, 1, 2]`) matches `groups[0]` (which is `[1, 2, 3]`). No match.
#    - Increment `j` to `1`.

# 3. **Second Iteration**:
#    - Check if `nums[1:4]` (which is `[1, 2, 3]`) matches `groups[0]`. Match found.
#    - Move `j` to `4` (i.e., `1 + 3`), and `i` to `1`.

# 4. **Third Iteration**:
#    - Check if `nums[4:6]` (which is `[4, 5]`) matches `groups[1]` (which is `[3, 4]`). No match.
#    - Increment `j` to `5`.

# 5. **Fourth Iteration**:
#    - Check if `nums[5:7]` (which is `[5]`) matches `groups[1]` (which is `[3, 4]`). No match.
#    - Increment `j` to `6`.

# 6. **End of Loop**:
#    - The loop ends because `j` has reached the end of `nums` and `i` is still `1` which is not equal to `len_groups` (2). So, the output is False, which is correct
